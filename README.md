# QOL-scripts
Various quality of life CLI automation scripts for efficient day-to-day queries. The purpose of each script is described below, ordered by date.

### calc
A quick Python executable that calculates logarithms, e.g. `calc log 2 8` as Google & Desmos don't have such a feature, and I prefer CLIs over GUIs. Other features include unit conversion for weight, distance, and speed, detailed documentation and error handling.

### pdfTexter
A few lines of Bash that convert my 5GB of PDF textbooks to text, allowing efficient search.
